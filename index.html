        <p>I love baking cakes because I love Eating cakes. They are very delicious and they look very pretty after icing. I like to do the icing part the best.Baking is a creative process. It gets the creative juices flowing by getting down to bake that recipe you have wanted. Repetitive and simple activities are often the ones which give you the most calming feelings.</p>
